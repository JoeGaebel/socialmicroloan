# But, why?
-----
I just moved to San Francisco to work at a startup as an intern for a year, and I just spent the last two weeks trying to find a place to live.
My criteria hasn't been all that crazy, I was looking for something

* in the city
* with tolerable roommates
* and under $2000 per month

I went through literally a thousand ads on craigslist. I would know, I made a spreadsheet to record them all...

<br>
Out of those 1000 ads, 20 responded. Out of those 20, I got to meet with 10. Of those 10, my three criteria didn't hold up.
I thought to myself,
> there must be a better way

As I lamented to my friend about the housing situation in SF, he joked
> "Maybe you should live on a boat"

**What a genius idea.**

# Okay so gimme the details
-----
From my research I found out that:
1. You can **BUY** a sailboat here for around $4,000
2. Docking fees cost around $200 per month
3. Some marinas let you live on your boat

A year of rent in San Francisco is around<br>
```
12 months x $2000 per month = $24,000 per year
```

A year of rent on San Francisco bay would be<br>
```
12 months x $200 per month + $4000 initial cost = $6,400 per year
```
<br>
Meaning that I could save almost 18 THOUSAND dollars from this campaign.

# Let's talk financials
-----
As an intern, I make $15 bucks an hour. With 40 hour work weeks, that makes me <br>
```
$15/hour * 40 hour weeks * 52 weeks in a year / 12 months in a year = $2,600 per month
```

I need $3000 ontop of my own savings in order to buy the boat and be able to eat until the next pay.<br>
The money will go entirely to buying the boat.
<br>
I'm willing to offer 5% interest on the loan, and I intend to pay it back in 3 months.<br>
This puts the monthly payment at $1050, leaving me with $1,550 left to pay the rest of my expenses.

I'm budgeting

* $50 phone bill
* $400 for food
* $200 for docking fee
* and $300 miscellaneous

<br>
**Total expenses per month: $950**<br>
**Leaving me a $600 buffer**

### It's tight, but I'm confident it will work.


# Okay, how's this boat?
-----
After scouring Craigslist, I found this one in particular. <br>
The owner says it's ship shape, and I brought a work colleague who is a veteran sailer who gave me the :+1: <br>
My colleague has said he'll teach me how to sail, and help me deal with the transition into boat life. <br>

# Let's do this!

I can't see any other way to affordably live in San Francisco. I need your help to make Boat Life 2016 a reality. <br>
Thank you for reading, and I hope to see you on the high seas!
